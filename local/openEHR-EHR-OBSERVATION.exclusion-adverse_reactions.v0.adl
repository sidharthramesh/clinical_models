The 'Statement' data element allows for recording of a single statement. Each exclusion should be recorded in a separate instance - for example a separate instance for a statement about medications and another for adverse reactions.

Please note that exclusion statements should only be considered to be current and accurate at the time of recording, and should not be assumed to be correct at a later date. For example, it is possible (and appropriate from a medico-legal point of view) for a clinician to record, based on history-taking, that an individual has NO KNOWN history of any adverse reactions (using an exclusion statement) but a few minutes later needing to record evidence of an adverse reaction that occurred in response to administration of penicillin.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to record the exclusion of a specific adverse reaction - use the EVALUATION.exclusion_specific archetype for this purpose.

Not to be used to record the absence of information - use the EVALUATION.absence archetype for this purpose.">
