This archetype has been designed to capture the actual amount of alcohol consumed per drink when nested within the context of an Alcohol Intake diary (OBSERVATION.alcohol_intake), or the typical amount consumed when nested within the context of the Alcohol consumption summary (EVALUATION.alcohol_consumption_summary). These parameters can be used to calculate the mass of alcohol consumed.">
