			purpose = <"To record a positive and explicit statement about exclusion of known current and/or past conditions, treatments or significant aspects of clinical history.">

			use = <"Use to enable a clinician, at a specified point of time, to record a clear and unambiguous statement about exclusion of known current and/or past conditions, treatments or significant aspects of clinical history. This approach is used in preference to relying on flags or terminology to express negation. 

The scope of exclusions should be limited to clinically significant concepts, in particular where it is relevant to patient safety, informing clinical decision-making or medico-legal documentation. It is not intended to encourage recording exclusions of any or all health information.

The 'Statement' data element allows for recording of a single statement. Each exclusion should be recorded in a separate instance - for example a separate instance for a statement about medications and another for adverse reactions.

Please note that exclusion statements should only be considered to be current and accurate at the time of recording, and should not be assumed to be correct at a later date. For example, it is possible (and appropriate from a medico-legal point of view) for a clinician to record, based on history-taking, that an individual has NO KNOWN history of any adverse reactions (using an exclusion statement) but a few minutes later needing to record evidence of an adverse reaction that occurred in response to administration of penicillin. In future record statements, the individual may have a KNOWN history of the problem or diagnosis recorded in their problem list.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to record the exclusion of a specific problem/diagnosis, medication, procedure, family history, adverse reaction or other clinical item - use the EVALUATION.exclusion_specific archetype for this purpose.

Not to be used to record the exclusion of symptoms use the CLUSTER.exclusion_symptom archetype within an appropriate OBSERVATION or CLUSTER archetype.

Not to be used to record the absence of information - use the EVALUATION.absence archetype for this purpose.">
