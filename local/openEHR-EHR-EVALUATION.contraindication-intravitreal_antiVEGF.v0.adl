This contraindication may be identified in a number of ways, for example: 
- previous experience of a procedure being performed and subsequent clinical assessment that this should not be repeated; 
- genomic testing results that indicate an adverse event may take place if a treatment or medication is administered; or
- experience of a family member to a similar treatment, medication or procedure.

Clinical decision support for prescribing should include checking of both known adverse reactions to the proposed medicine (EVALUATION.adverse_reaction) plus known contraindications using this archetype.">
